Running the code
Change the path of both data files.
Run corona_tracer.py and it will show list of patient ids who transferred corona to patients who got infected on 12-03-2020.
You can change input date and it will show other patients spreading the corona virus.

If this is run recursively we can track all the places which are infected.
We can also track the patient-0.
